ðŸ“¦ WMS MVP â€“ SKU to MSKU Mapping App
This is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) submission for the Warehouse Management System (WMS) assignment by CSTE International.
It allows users to upload and process sales data and SKU-to-MSKU mapping files using a clean, intuitive interface built with Streamlit. The app outputs a merged file and highlights unmapped SKUs for manual review.
